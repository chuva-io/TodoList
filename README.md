## Mission 🧕🏾 👨🏻‍💼 👩🏼‍💼
This project was created to supplement the [Swift Miami meetup](http://link.com) and give the community - and more importantly, those new to Swift and/or software development - a place to build something together.

We welcome and encourage diversity and collaboration from everyone.

#### Teaching & Learning
As simple as a to-do list is, it allows us to add lots of different features. We wanted to build something simple that allows us to focus on aspects of Swift development that people encounter every day, while also allowing room for the most complex issues we may face in the real world.

Say hello to our tutorial-style project!
Some things we would like to cover are:
- Local storage (Core Data, Realm, etc.)
- UI (animation, pure code, storyboards, etc.)
- Server-side Swift (Build and consume an API with user accounts)
- Unit testing
- MVC & MVVM
- Accessibility & localization
- Dependency management (Cocoapods, Carthage, manual, etc.)
- Functional Reactive Programming (Reactive Swift, RxSwift, etc.)
- App extensions (today view, Siri, etc.)
- Apple watch app
- Machine Learning (CoreML, Metal, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Location-based features

## Contributing 👨🏿‍💻
Want to give us a hand? Start working on one of our open issues.  
Here's how you can get started:
>   
To work on [Issue #1](https://github.com/chuva-io/TodoList/issues/1) - *Add a todo list view*:
- Create a branch with the following prefix: `GH-[ISSUE NUMBER]`  
e.g. `GH-1`
- Prefix all commits with `GH-[ISSUE NUMBER] - `  
e.g. `GH-1 - Add a todo list view`
- Submit a pull request!
>  

We will follow the raywenderlich.com [Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) pretty closely. It's a good reference for beginners but don't focus on it too much. Just keep things clean, readable, and consistent!

#### We need all the help we can get!
- Do you love UI design? Want to use our app as your playground? **We could use a designer!**
- Are you an aspiring **product manager**? We can use your help in driving the direction and priorities of the app!
- Wanna get down with **server-side Swift**?! This project is going to need a backend eventually...
